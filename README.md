How do I see this project? (things that I don't understand at all):
-
I need some install scripts for configuring OS, server, backend. I don't understand how it have be implemeted, but noone can stop me ;-)
I need framework, probable it will be Flask. I need forms, db and something else.

How do I see this project? (things that I can):
-
I plan to write frontend with CSS3+HTML5+jQuery. I think CSS3 is the most important technology, because it is fast and efficient way to make great-looking face even with animations.
